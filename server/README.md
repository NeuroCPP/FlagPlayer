## CORS Server

#### Local setup:
1. Download the project (master)
2. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
3. Execute /server/Setup.bat (Windows) or /server/Setup.sh (Linux)
4. Execute /server/CorsServer.bat (Windows) or /server/CorsServer.sh (Linux)
5. Note your local server adress as displayed in the console, usually http://localhost:26060
6. Open the settings in FlagPlayer (gear top right)
7. Enter local server adress into the Cors Server field

Note: You need to start the local CORS server (step 4) every time OR set it up as a service  
You can also copy the .bat/.sh and put it on your desktop - just edit it to point to the yt-server.js file
